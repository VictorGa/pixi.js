Fork that unleashes true power of Pixi.JS
=============

![pixi.js logo](Pixi_gob.jpg)

The aim of this fork is to experiment with [pixi.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js) and test new APIs that may be will be merged into official library.

### List of features ###

0. static transforms &mdash; No point of re-calculating matrices every frame if most of the scene is static.

1. Camera with z-index/z-order and culling &mdash; Ordering was pain in PIXI and Phaser. Now its gone!

2. Multiple cameras, proxy containers &mdash; Wanna make repeating world, make it like Thorus? Proxies FTW!

3. 2.5D transforms &mdash; Best of both worlds!

Test new APIs in [examples](https://gameofbombs.github.io/pixi-bin/index.html)

Binaries are located in [pixi-bin repository](https://github.com/gameofbombs/pixi-bin/bin/)
